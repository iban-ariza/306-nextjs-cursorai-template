So @taskFormSchema should be used in both @createTask() and inside the @task-dialog.tsx form.

The schema needs to change. Remove priority and dueDate and add the columnId, based on @tasks 

Don't add the order to the ZOD schema, as it will be generated later.

Don't do anything else I didn't ask for.
