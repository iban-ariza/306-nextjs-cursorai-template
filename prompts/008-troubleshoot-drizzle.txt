Only do those points below, NOTHING ELSE!

1) We dont have an src folder, so move everything into the lib one
2) Next up, we seem not to have .env file and additionally, let's just use DB_URL, not separate env vars
3) Use @docker-compose.yml for credentials
4) For @drizzle.config.ts use this format instead:

import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";
 
export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./schema/*",
  out: "./drizzle",
  dialect: 'postgresql',
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DB_URL,
  }
});


For reference use: @https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview 

5) Fix the @config.ts to use the DB_URL as well
