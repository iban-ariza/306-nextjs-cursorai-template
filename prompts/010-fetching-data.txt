We need to fetch columns & tasks.

This shhould achieved through:
- It's Next.js so use Server Components when possible
- Use server actions when possible
- Use Next.js 15

For now only handle the column & task fetching, storing/updating/deleting - this should ignored for now.

Make sure not to use useEffect.
