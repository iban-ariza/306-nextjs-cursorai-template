I need to move tasks horizontally. For now, just build the UI @Forms & Frontend. It should be an option in the dropdown menu inside @task-card.tsx. It should do basic checks if there's a column to move to, if there's not, don't show the option. Make sure to implement this only withon @task-card.tsx - except if info about available columns is needed, pass it down from @kanban-board.tsx somehow.
