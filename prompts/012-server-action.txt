I'd like to store the new task. There's the @task-dialog.tsx . Please create a server action that will store a new task. There's already the client side validation, but please reuse the same schema on the backend and validate the task again inside the server action.

Please also simplify the flow, so that the task is stored immediatelly, and we don't pass so many event handlers through components.
